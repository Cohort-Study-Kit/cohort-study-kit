# Cohort Study Kit

Cohort Study Kit is an open-source platform for managing longitudinal cohort studies. It provides a complete solution for collecting, storing, and managing research data from study participants over time.

Originally developed for the COPSAC (Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood) project, this software is designed to be adaptable for any research project requiring systematic data collection and management.

## Key Features

- **Form Builder**: Create custom data collection forms with advanced validation rules
- **Visit Management**: Schedule and track participant visits
- **Participant Records**: Comprehensive participant management including:
  - Contact information and demographics
  - Family relationships
  - Medical history
  - Visit records
  - Custom data points
- **Data Security**: Built-in security features to protect sensitive research data
- **Export Capabilities**: Easy data export for analysis
- **Multi-user Support**: Different access levels for researchers, nurses, and administrators

## Technology Stack

- Django framework for robust backend functionality
- MariaDB (production) / SQLite (development) for data storage
- Modern JavaScript for responsive frontend
- Bootstrap for clean, professional UI

The LGPL license was chosen because:
- It ensures the core library remains open source while allowing it to be used in any project, including proprietary ones
- Modifications to the library itself must be shared back with the community
- Research organizations can integrate it into their systems without being forced to open-source their entire codebase
- It promotes collaboration while protecting both open-source values and practical usability in research environments
